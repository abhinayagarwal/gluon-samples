# CloudLink-Combined-Storage

A JavaFX application that uses Gluon Mobile Glisten (a mobile application framework with mobile-friendly UI controls) and 
Gluon CloudLink to manage storage of notes both locally in the device and remotely in the cloud, with a combined strategy.

## Prerequisites

You need a valid subscription to Gluon CloudLink. You can get it [here](http://gluonhq.com/products/cloudlink/buy/), and 
there is a 30-day free trial. Sign up and get a valid account on Gluon CloudLink and a link to download the Gluon CloudLink 
Dashboard. 

Install and open the Dashboard, and sign in using the Gluon account credentials provided above. Go to the App Management view, and you will 
find a pair of key/secret tokens. Save the file `gluoncloudlink_config.json` under your project 
`src/main/resources/` folder. The content of the file is a JSON object with the key and secret that will grant access
to Gluon CloudLink:

```json
{
  "gluonCredentials": {
    "applicationKey": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "applicationSecret": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
}
```
